        <h5>Paragraphs</h5> 
        <p class="a">In my opinion, "freedom of speech" means that people should speak and express opinions freely, and their rights to speak is protected but restricted in certain circumstances. "Freedom of speech" should be treated in the University of Washington following the concept of "Isegoria" which every student and faculty members should have equal rights to participate in speech. Students and faculty members definitely should be allowed to speak, however, people outside of campus should be considered thoughtfully about their topic and intention for speech.</p>

        <p class="b">The First Amendment supports my position by stating that "Congress shall make no law...abridging freedom of speech", so that students and faculty members have rights to speak freely, however, within some restrictions which the First Amendment presents as abridgments.</p>
